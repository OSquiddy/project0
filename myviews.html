        <p>Sports are amazing. There are hundreds of different kinds of sports and chances are you can find one to your liking.
          However, it is more important to play the sport that you like rather than just watch others play it. Although watching is
          fun, it does not do much to actually improve your game. Unless you're watching with the intention of adopting plays that
          you witness, and not just fawning over your favorite game or player.</p>
          <br>
          In addition to improving your physical fitness, sports are a way for people to learn leadership qualities, teamplay, controlled
          aggression and fairness. They are a great form of socializing and help people bond with strangers. My recommendation is to find 2
          sports that you enjoy, one that is team based, and another that you can enjoy solo, because that way someone who wants to take a
          timeout from being in the presence of others can cool off somewhere. Personally, I've found that swimming is great at cooling me
          down, both figuratively and literally.

          <p>We live in the 21st century. Racism is something that we should have left behind long ago. It does not take a genius to figure
            out that under the surface, we are all the same. The same thing applies to hypernationalism. At the end of the day, we are all
            part of the species 'homo sapien'. Beind proud of the land you were born in, thinking it somehow makes you inherently better than
            others is also something that we should strive to drop.</p>

            <p>I was brought up watching animated movies. I love them! My all-time favourite would definitely be The Lion King(1995). I've watched that
            movie close to 50 times and I've yet to get bored of it. Spirit: Stallion of the Cimmarron was another great movie. A DreamWorks film,
          it followed the journey of a wild horse in the Old West that had been captured by the US Military, and his struggles in getting back to his
            herd. The score for the film is absolutely phenomenal. 10/10 would recommend anyone to watch it.</p>
            <p>There are some folks who feel that watching 'cartoons' is lame. I beg to differ. It takes a lot of time and effort to animate a movie, and many
            times the end result is far more enjoyable than an actual movie. You could look at Avatar: The Last Airbender for example. The movie absolutely sucked
            but the show still has a pretty strong fan following. The story and the message that it sends are pretty great too!</p>

              <p>Video games have always been a part of our generation. Whereas once they were just a past time for people, in today's time, gaming is actually a decent
              profession. The average professional gamers earn around $60,000 per year. If you are really good, you could earn millions yearly, including other perks
              like travel arrangements, sponsorships and prizes.</p>
              <p>The most popular games in eSports in the year 2019 were:
               <ul>
                 <li>Fortnite</li>
                 <li>Counter Strike: Global Offensive</li>
                 <li>Dota 2</li>
                 <li>League of Legends</li>

              <p>Exploring the world is something that every person must try to do at least once in their lifetimes. Maybe take a year off after highschool
              or perhaps volunteer to work for an NGO abroad, or even try to go abroad as a foreign exchange student. It is a vital step to growing as a person:
              experiencing other cultures and realising that even after all these differences, human beings have managed to come together whenever it matters.
              I've been lucky in the fact that I've had to oppurtunity to travel to many countries already. The dream is to visit each country in the world at least
              once.</p>
