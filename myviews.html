    <div class="Intro">
      <p> This is a collection of my ramblings and thougts on various topics. Not to be taken very seriously.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Sports">
      <h1>Sports</h1>
      <p>Sports are amazing. There are hundreds of different kinds of sports and chances are you can find one to your liking.
      However, it is more important to play the sport that you like rather than just watch others play it. Although watching is
      fun, it does not do much to actually improve your game. Unless you're watching with the intention of adopting plays that
      you witness, and not just fawning over your favorite game or player.</p>
      <br>
      In addition to improving your physical fitness, sports are a way for people to learn leadership qualities, teamplay, controlled
      aggression and fairness. They are a great form of socializing and help people bond with strangers. My recommendation is to find 2
      sports that you enjoy, one that is team based, and another that you can enjoy solo, because that way someone who wants to take a
      timeout from being in the presence of others can cool off somewhere. Personally, I've found that swimming is great at cooling me
      down, both figuratively and literally.

    <div class="Racism">
      <h1>Racism and Other Discrimination</h1>
      <p>We live in the 21st century. Racism is something that we should have left behind long ago. It does not take a genius to figure
      out that under the surface, we are all the same. The same thing applies to hypernationalism. At the end of the day, we are all
      part of the species 'homo sapien'. Beind proud of the land you were born in, thinking it somehow makes you inherently better than
      others is also something that we should strive to drop.</p>
