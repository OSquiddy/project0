CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Project 0 by OSquiddy.

I have created a sort of portfolio website for my self in
this project. It contains 6 pages:

index.html
education.html
myviews.html
hobbies.html
aboutme.html
contactme.html

It has been created using only HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. 
I picked up some design ideas from the MDBootstrap page,
but linking a reference to their stylesheet was slowing
down my website's loading speed. I decided to try and 
recreate the components that I liked using my own classes
and ids. The 'Contact Me' page is an example of this. The 
base layer is the basic bootstrap font, but I've added custom
CSS over it to get the look that I was going for.

The 'card containers' on the 'Hobbies' page are also another
example of me recreating a bootstrap component. I was not able 
to efficiently manipulate the card component given in bootstrap,
so I hoped that recreating that component on my own would give me 
a greater degree of control. 

I'm quite pleased with this first attempt at making a decent website.
I have never used CSS in this format before / made something like this
before, even though I had done a very basic introductory course on CSS a few years
ago. I've thoroughly enjoyed playing around with the properites and settings
this past week and am ready to move on to the next parts of the course.

I hope you like what you see!
