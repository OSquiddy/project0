      <p>I started my education at the tender age of 4 years old. Like many people in the world before me, this was my introduction
      to the prison cell called 'Kindergarten'. Luckily I had a full extra year to enjoy at home, unlike my poor cousins, who were
      sent off to nursery at the age of 3. Life is harsh for a young Indian toddler.

      What's that? You're not interested in hearing the story of my formative years? Fine, I'll entertain you just this once, but I
      generally do not like timeskips. Messes with the flow of the story. Anyway, moving on!

      <p>I studied in private school in Sharjah, the oft ignored younger sibling of the famous emirates Dubai and Abu Dhabi.
      My intellectually handicapped younger self chose to pursue Science after Grade 10, a choice I would come to regret on and
      off for the next 6 years. I struggled with many subjects, Computer Science in particular throughout Grade 11. Luckily for me,
       with Grade 12 came a new Computer Sc. teacher who noticed that our education in the subject was subpar compared to others
      she had taught. She went through the trouble of teaching us everything right from the basics, and it was here that my love for
      the subject took root in my heart.</p>
