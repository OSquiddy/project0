              <h3>The Start</h3>
              <p>I started my education at the tender age of 4 years old. Like many people in the world before me, this was my introduction
                to the prison cell called 'Kindergarten'. Luckily I had a full extra year to enjoy at home, unlike my poor cousins, who were
                sent off to nursery at the age of 3. Life is harsh for a young Indian toddler.

                What's that? You're not interested in hearing the story of my formative years? Fine, I'll entertain you just this once, but I
                generally do not like timeskips. Messes with the flow of the story. Anyway, moving on!

            <div id = "HighSchool" class="my-3">
              <p>I studied in private school in Sharjah, the oft ignored younger sibling of the famous emirates Dubai and Abu Dhabi.
                My intellectually handicapped younger self chose to pursue Science after Grade 10, a choice I would come to regret on and
                off for the next 6 years. I struggled with many subjects, Computer Science in particular throughout Grade 11. Luckily for me,
                with Grade 12 came a new Computer Sc. teacher who noticed that our education in the subject was subpar compared to others
                she had taught. She went through the trouble of teaching us everything right from the basics, and it was here that my love for
                the subject took root in my heart.</p>

              <div id="College" class="my-3">
                <p>Started at Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi on the 15th of August, 2015. Spent 4 years of my life there. It had its ups and downs.
                The friendships I formed there are some of the strongest relationships I've formed. The studies on the other hand, were nothing really
                special. I was part of the IEEE team though. That was pretty fun. We were involved in plenty of acitivities: organizing workshops, events,
                fests etc. It was a pretty fun society to be a part of.</p>

              <h5> Summary </h5>
              <p>Here I talk about my schooling experiences and how they shaped me to be the man I am today. There is a lot to read about so get
                ready to get bored. Or you might enjoy it. Who knows? </p>
