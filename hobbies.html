      <h2>Reading</h2>
      <p>I'm a big fan of reading. Mostly fantasy fiction though. Loved that genre ever since I was a child, and haven't outgrown
      it yet. Harry Potter is a classic. Percy Jackson is one such other. One of my old favourites used to be the Inheritance Cycle
      but I haven't read it in a long time. A few other series worth mentioning:
      <ul>
        <li>Kane Chronicles</li>
        <li>Wheel of Time Series</li>
        <li>Bartimaeus Trilogy</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

    <div id="Exercise" class="mx-5 my-3">
      <h2>Exercise</h2>
      <p>Exercizing your body is just as important as exercizing your mind. While reading and coding are good for you brain, they don't
      really do much for your body. My main form of exercize has been to hit the gym for the past few years, but before that I used to go
      swimming regularly. Unfortunately, the university I studied in did not have access to a swimming pool and there were no public pools
      available nearby for me to use.</p>
