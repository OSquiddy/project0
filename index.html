        Hello, world!

            This is the main page of my website, where I talk about things that interest me.

          <p>
            I am a soon to be 23 year old engineering graduate with dreams of transitioning into the Computer Science field.
            Been studying on my own to get the skills necessary to land me a good job in the industry, seeing as my plans for
            enrollment into a Master's course have been postponed because of this new pandemic.

          <p> There is not a lot to do on this page. I suggest you use the table to move on to the next pages. Or alternatively,
          you can click here. </p>
          <p>Lol just kidding. That link won't take you anywhere. You <i>should</i> go back to the table.</p>
