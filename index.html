            I am a soon to be 23 year old engineering graduate with dreams of transitioning into the Computer Science field.
            Been studying on my own to get the skills necessary to land me a good job in the industry, seeing as my plans for
            enrollment into a Master's course have been postponed because of this pandemic.
          </p>
          Given below is a list of software skills that I have picked up and that I plan to
          pick up in the coming few months.

          <p>I'm currently trying to learn as many new technologies as possible. The main problem I'm facing is that the field is too vast.
          I am currently unable to make up my mind between 4 disciplines:
          <ul>
            <li>Software Development</li>
            <li>Web Development</li>
            <li>Cloud Computing</li>
            <li>Game Development</li>
          </ul>
          I have dabbled in all 4 fields and have enjoyed my experience in all of them. However, this has resulted in my being confused as to which
          field I ultimately want to pursue in my professional life.
